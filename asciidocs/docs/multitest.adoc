WARNING: This Document is still under construction!

== Current state
Previous iterations and development versions of franklyn have made it possible to support a single exam at a time, by continuously capturing the screen of students and storing the results on one central server. Using the instructor UI, the instructor could either watch the captured screenshots while the exam is ongoing or a generated video after the fact. A more detailed description of the current state of franklyn can be found <<./status-reports/2024-10-07-status-report.adoc#,here>>

== Problems
Only managing a single exam at a time is a severe limitation of franklyn and assuming there is only one exam at any given time would be a bold assumption even for smaller educational institutions.

== Task
To solve the problem described above, franklyn adapted to support multiple concurrent exams. Further details regarding the architecture, interfaces and other design choices can be found below.

== Goals
Franklyn3 is ready to be used during exams as a support system. Franklyn will allow examinees to write their exams under realistic conditions, such as having access to the internet. At the same time, teachers can still ensure that the examinees comply with certain rules.

== Architecture
WARNING: As Franklyn is still under heavy development, no interfaces, components and design decisions are set in stone and are subject to change.

=== Overview
The following diagram shows a rough architectural overview of a fully deployed version of franklyn.

As you can see franklyn consists of many different components. A short description of each of them will follow:

==== Openbox (Rust)
===== Description
The Openbox, also called student-client, is a piece of natively compiled GUI software running on the machines of all participating examinees (students).

===== Purpose
The main responsibility of the Openbox application is to periodically send images of the examinees screen to the central franklyn server. Additionally, it also handles the registration process, by providing Input fields for a PIN and student name and sending the entered values to the central franklyn server to start the login process.

==== Franklyn Server (Quarkus)
===== Description
The central Quarkus server application (franklyn server) is the core component of franklyn.

===== Purpose
The franklyn server application has a wide range of tasks it has to perform:

* Periodically asking clients for screenshots
* Storing received screenshots on the filesystem and adding corresponding databse rows
* Answering exam requests from the instructor client
** Create a new exam
** Delete an old exam
** Get a list of exams
** Get the latest screenshot of an examinee
* Building videos from the captured screenshots

This is only a part of the interface of the franklyn server. A more detailed description is provided below.

==== Instructor-client (Angular)
The franklyn instructed frontend implemented using angular, is the interface between the instructor and the franklyn server application. It allows instructors to watch their active exams (screenshots of examinee screens), review previous exams and manage (create, update, delete) exams.

==== Nginx Servers
Franklyn makes use of multiple nginx servers:

* *franklyn-reverse-proxy*: Is responsible for routing incoming traffic to the respective application (frontend webserver or franklyn-server). Additionally, it is also responsible for providing SSL certificates to enable encrypted communication over the internet. While allowing http on the host machine.
* *franklyn-instructor-client-server*: Static file hosting server, which provides the angular frontend to REST clients

=== Component communication
This communication section takes a closer look at the individual components of franklyn and offers a more detailed description of the interfaces they use to communicate with each other.

==== Description of external interfaces
===== Introduction: Datatypes
The interfaces below mostly use `JSON` for transferring data. The `JSON` format includes types instead of example values to ease implementation. The following datatypes are used:

1. Composite types (`type1 | type2 | ...`): Composite types signal that the field contains a value of one of the types. In this example the type is either `type1` or `type2`
1. Composite constants (`"CONST1" | "CONST2" | ...`): Composite constants are similar to composite types however they signal, that the value of the field is one of the listed constants. In this example the value is either `CONST1` or `CONST2`
1. `string`: All valid json strings
1. `number`: All valid json numbers
1. `isodatetime`: String formatted as an ISO 8601 Datetime string
1. `null`: null value (value missing)
1. `boolean`: boolean value meaning either `true` or `false`
1. `object`: another `JSON` object (`{}`) with unspecified contents

===== Command Socket
The command socket allows bidirectional communication between franklyn-server and the student-client. It uses the `Websocket` protocol. Even though the websocket server is running on franklyn-server this interface is a required interface of the server, since currently only the server sends commands through this bidirectional tunnel. The client's response is provided by it calling REST endpoints. The websocket server is available under `/connect/{session-id}`

====== General command structure
A command sent to the student-client generally looks like the following:
+
[source, json]
----
{
  "type": "CAPTURE_SCREEN",
  "payload": object | null
}
----
NOTE: Currently, there is only one command type `CAPTURE_SCREEN`, however in the future there may be more and the datatype will look similar to: `"CMD1" | "CMD2" | "CMD3" | ...`

====== Request screenshot
* *Description*: Requests a screencapture from the student-client (openbox)
* *Command structure*:
+
[source, json]
----
{
  "type": "CAPTURE_SCREEN",
  "payload": {
    "frame_type": "ALPHA" | "BETA"
  }
}
----
* *Expected Response*: `POST` request to the telemetry endpoint for the given frametype. I.e. `/telemetry/by-session/{session-id}/screen/upload/alpha` for alpha frames and `/telemetry/by-session/{session-id}/screen/upload/beta` for beta frames
* *Additional Notes*: N/A

====== Heartbeat (Ping/Pong)
Besides requesting commands, the server periodically sends small `PING` packets and expects `PONG` responses. This is an exception to the rule, that the server does not accept its responses over the websocket tunnel. Since `PING`/`PONG` is implemented on a protocol level for `Websockets`, simplifying implementations for breaking "rules" is a tradeoff made here.

===== Telemetry upload
Telemetry upload is another `REST` endpoint of the franklyn-server which acts as an interface for the student-client (openbox) to upload its captured telemetry. Currently, this resource is mostly used image data.

====== Upload alpha frame
* *Path*: `/telemetry/by-session/{session-id}/screen/upload/alpha`
* *Method*: `POST`
* *Description*: `POST` here to upload a new alpha-frame for the given user session
* *Request format*: `Path param` + `octet-stream`
* *Request structure*: `/telemetry/by-session/{session-id}/upload/screen/alpha` where `{session-id}` is a valid session uuid, which the student-client receives when calling `join`. Additionally, the body contains an octet stream containing the image of the screen.
* *Response format*: N/A
* *Response structure*: N/A
* *Additional Notes*: Alpha frames are complete images of the screen in a png format.

====== Upload beta frame
* *Path*: `/telemetry/by-session/{session-id}/screen/upload/beta`
* *Method*: `POST`
* *Description*: `POST` here to upload a new beta-frame for the given user session
* *Request format*: `Path param` + `octet-stream`
* *Request structure*: `/telemetry/by-session/{session-id}/upload/screen/beta` where `{session-id}` is a valid session uuid, which the student-client receives when calling `join`. Additionally, the body contains an octet stream containing the difference from the last alpha-frame uploaded
* *Response format*: N/A
* *Response structure*: N/A
* *Additional Notes*: Beta frames are not complete images of the screen. Instead, a beta frame is the difference (in terms of pixels and colors) from the last alpha frame. This type of frame used to save bandwidth while uploading screencaptures. Beta frames are also in the png image format.

===== Participate
The participate interface is a `REST` interface used by the student-client to establish an initial connection and register for an exam.

====== Join Exam
* *Path*: `/exams/join/{pin}`
* *Method*: `POST`
* *Description*: Allows student-clients to register for participation in an exam
* *Request format*: `Path param` + `JSON`
* *Request structure*: `/exams/join/{pin}` where `{pin}` is a valid 3 digit PIN of an exam. Additionally, the following body is required:
+
[source, json]
----
{
  "firstname": string,
  "lastname": string
}

* *Response format*: `Location header`
* *Response structure*: Location header containing the full url student-clients have to connect to, to receive commands (`Command Interface`) +
e.g. `http://localhost:8080/connect/a353a68b-26f2-4803-8abf-80d4bbbc7f55`
* *Additional Notes*: This method idempotent, in the sense that it may be called multiple times and always returns the same connection string. This avoids duplicate student entries if a student-client is fully restarted.
