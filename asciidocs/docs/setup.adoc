== Introduction
Franklyn's architecture currently consists of three major components:

* an Angular frontend
* a quarkus server responsible for recording screenshots and managing clients
* a quarkus client running on each student pc during an exam

== Native installation
Franklyn can be installed natively without the use of containerization software like docker.

For this the following things are needed:

* some linux-based server
* the ability to use sudo
* a static public ip-address
* the ability to open ports to the internet (in particular *80* and *443*)
* a domain name

IMPORTANT: The following commands in this tutorial are assuming the server is running **Ubuntu-server-22.04-LTS**. Commands might be different when using a different linux distribution.

=== Server and Frontend
==== Setting up nginx
The first step of setting up franklyn is installing a webserver. In this tutorial we will be using *nginx*. To install nginx the following commands have to be executed in a terminal:
[source, shell]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
----
After installation make sure the nginx service is running using:
[source, shell]
----
sudo systemctl status nginx
----
Amidst the output one should see `Active: active (running)`.
In case `Active: inactive (dead)` is shown instead try enabling and starting the nginx service using:
[source, shell]
----
sudo systemctl enable --now nginx
----

The next thing to do is set up port-forwarding of port 80 and 443. Depending on the used provider the required steps might look vastly different.

====
In case an oracle virtual machine is used, the following steps can be used to set up port-forwarding:

Go to the dashboard and click on *virtual cloud networks*

Then click on the virtual cloud network the instance is in

image::oracloud_vcn_select.png[]

Followed by a click on the available subnet

image::oracloud_subn_select.png[]

And a click on the default security list

image::oracloud_sec_list_select.png[]

Finally, add a new ingress rule

image::oracloud_add_ingress.png[]

And enter the following:

image::oracloud_ingress_conf.png[]

Click on `Add Ingress Rules`.

Lastly execute the following commands in the instances' terminal:
[source, shell]
----
sudo apt install firewalld
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
----
====

When done correctly visiting `http://<public-ip>` should show a nginx welcome screen:

image::nginx_welcome.png[]

Before continuing make sure the domain name points to the public ip-address of the server. Usually this can be configured on the domain-name providers website.

When done correctly visiting `http://<domain-name>` should now also show the same nginx welcome screen.

The next step is getting a certificate for the domain. Use the following commands to install certbot on the server:
[source, shell]
----
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
----

After that run `sudo certbot certonly --nginx` to generate a new certificate for the domain. This will ask a few basic questions including an e-mail address and the domain name.

Using the certificate nginx can now be configured to use tls. Overwrite `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` with the following:
[source]
----
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;

events {}

http {
	include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
	server {
		listen 80;
    server_name <your-domain-name>;

		return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
	}

	server {
		server_name <your-domain-name>;
		root /var/www/html;
		index index.html;

		location /api/ {
			proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
			# Websocket support
			proxy_http_version 1.1;
			proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
			proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
			# increase max file upload limit
			client_max_body_size 100M;
		}

		location / {
			try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
		}

		listen 443 ssl;

		ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<your-domain-name>/fullchain.pem;
		ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<your-domain-name>/privkey.pem;
		include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
		ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;
	}
}
----
And restart nginx with:
[source, shell]
----
sudo systemctl restart nginx
----

=== Setup Frontend and Server
Now that nginx is set up the frontend and server applications are next.
First install git and clone the franklyn GitHub repository:
[source, shell]
----
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/2324-4bhif-syp/2324-4bhif-syp-project-franklyn.git
----

For building the project the following dependencies are required:

* `java 17` or newer
* `node 18` or newer

To install them execute:
[source, shell]
----
# for java
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk
sudo apt install maven

# for node
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install node
----

Now enter the project directory and build the frontend and server (this might take a while):
[source, shell]
----
cd 2324-4bhif-syp-project-franklyn/
./cicd/build-instructor-client.sh
./cicd/build-server.sh
----

Finally, copy the frontend to the directory nginx expects it to be:
[source, shell]
----
sudo cp -r dist/instructor-client/* /var/www/html
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
sudo systemctl restart nginx
----

Lastly set up a storage directory for the server and start the jar-file
[source, shell]
----
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/franklyn
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/lib/franklyn
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/lib/franklyn
java -jar dist/server/franklyn-server.jar
----

You should now see the franklyn angular app when visiting https://<domain-name>:

image::frontend_pic.png[]

Since running the server using `java -jar <path-to-jar>` is bad let's create a service for it:

.franklyn.service
[source, unitfile(systemd)]
----
[Unit]
Description=Franklyn server software

[Service]
User=<service-user>
Group=<service-group>
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar <path-to-franklyn-server-jar>

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

Make sure to create the service file in the correct directory or move it afterwards with:
[source,shell]
----
sudo mv <path-to-franklyn.service> /etc/systemd/system/
----

Finally, start the service and make sure it's running:
[source, shell]
----
sudo systemctl enable --now franklyn.service
sudo systemctl status franklyn.service
----

=== Student Client
The last thing to do is preparing the student client (also known as openbox). Why is this needed? Per default the generated openbox artifact on GitHub points at our development domain `franklyn.ddns.net`. To work with other servers this domain has to be changed and the jar rebuilt.

To do this clone the repository on a local computer:
[source, shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/2324-4bhif-syp/2324-4bhif-syp-project-franklyn.git
cd 2324-4bhif-syp-project-franklyn
----

Open `openbox/src/main/resources/application.properties` and change:
[source, properties]
----
%prod.websocket.url=wss://franklyn.ddns.net/api
%prod.http.url=https://franklyn.ddns.net/api
----
to
[source, properties]
----
%prod.websocket.url=wss://<your-domain-name>/api
%prod.http.url=https://<your-domain-name>/api
----

For building the student-client `java 17` or newer and maven is required. With these installed make sure you are in the project root and run:
[source, shell]
----
./cicd/build-openbox.sh
----

`dist/openbox/` now contains a file called `franklyn-student-client.jar`. This is the jar file which students have to execute using:
[source, shell]
----
java -jar franklyn-student-client.jar
----

You're set!
